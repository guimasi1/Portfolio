            After working as a physiotherapist, my desire to assist people on a larger scale steered
            me towards the field of <strong>web development</strong>. Consequently, I enrolled in a
            course at EPICODE school, dedicating myself to studying day and night for 6 months. My
            journey has been fueled by an enduring <strong>curiosity</strong> and a strong
            <strong>work ethic</strong> that has always characterized me.

            resource aimed at helping others.
